**Well I'm glad you asked and are interested enough to keep reading.**

That picture is me wearing a Burger King crown on stage during my High School's somewhat avant-garde production of "The Lark": A French play about Joan of Ark. 

Why a Burger King Crown? I was 'Charles the Dauphin', who -- in the play -- is a King, but is lacking any actual power as he is depicted as childish and bossed around by those around him. 

Eventually Charles gains courage to lead an army to help Joan of Ark, and at this point he puts on the crown.

...And Burger King crowns are such an interesting idea! Anyone can pick one up from their local Burger King and let their feudal and fast-food imaginations run wild. 

However, because of the abundance of Burger King crowns, they don't represent much real authority. Charles puts on this crown and feels powerful for a little while, but slowly realizes the lack of power that he still has as those around him begin ignoring him.

So yeah, it's kind of a cross of pop culture with some historical ideas. I'm no history or literary expert, but I came up with this crown idea and thought it was pretty cool.
