## Personal site number... 4?
The phrase "Work smarter, not harder" applies really well to this. While I love building sites from the ground up with HTML and CSS, creating a new personal site every year from scratch isn't a great use of my time. 

My hope is that starting with a template and using a new technology (Jekyll) will allow me to reach a final product that I'm happy with and can evolve, rather than get thrown out in a year or so. Modularity and the ability to easily add new things are the goals.
