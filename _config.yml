    Welcome to my newly-revised website! If this is your first time seeing this slideshow, 
    you'll likely get interrupted while reading this, 
    as the slideshow passively scrolls automatically after five seconds.

    I've had a personal website since 2017. This one is a customized fork of Github's 
    personal-website repository. I recently redid the website using Tailwind CSS, so I can more easily 
    adjust portions of the webiste.

    I have a music minor. I enjoy listening to all types of music 
    (Rap, R&B, New Wave, and Alternative Rock are some favorites though!) 
    Sometimes I compose my own music for fun. 
    I play percussion in UConn's Percussion Ensemble. I also play guitar in my free time!
  - This Summer, I'm an intern at Pega!
  - I love to rock climb. I've been climbing since I went to college.

    I'm a Microsoft Learn Beta Student Ambassador. In Spring 2021, I hosted a workshop at a 
    Hackathon to help students collaboratively code in Microsoft VSCode using LiveShare.

      My version of the board game "Secret Hitler" -- entirely online! 
      I made this so I could play one of my favorite board games with my friends while social distancing.
      It took about 2 weeks of focused development in May 2020 to make it fully playable, and gets
      frequent visits from my friends and I. It is now hosted at SecretHitler.js.org, so I removed the original 
      'Detective Dictator' branding.

      A Phone-Controlled karaoke guessing game!
    description: >
      Our Team's 2nd-place submission at HackUMass 2019! We wanted to recreate kahoot-style gameplay but 
      take it a step further. We created this Karaoke guessing game as a fun roof of concept of what can be done!
      Hosting a lobby requires a Spotify account, so if you want to host a game you should do it in a new window.

      Our Team's Winning Submission to the 2018 Connecticut Technology Council College Tech Challenge!
      It's a web-app providing resources and to opioid users and their families in Connecticut. It uses 
      data.ct.gov's rest API to access data and display helpful locations on Google Maps.

      Because Google now requires payment to use their maps API, some things may no longer show up correctly.

      My winning math-visualization project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon!
    description: >
      My winning project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon! Made in 24 hours, this is a version that has been adapted and
      optimized past that time limit for a single player, web experience. 
      The original was created for the Momath "Math Floor": A large, touchscreen floor.

      The project has been featured on the Museums instagram, and another web version was sent to Momath email 
      subscribers in May of 2020! It makes me happy that so many people have been able to enjoy something I made.

      My buddy Henry made this sprite in hopes of making a sidescrolling game.
      I made this song as the title track for the game.
      It never came to fruition, but I made this as a tribute.
