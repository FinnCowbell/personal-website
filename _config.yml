      My version of the board game "Secret Hitler" -- entirely online! 
      I made this so I could play one of my favorite board games with my friends while social distancing.
      It took about 2 weeks of focused development in May 2020 to make it fully playable, and gets
      frequent visits from my friends and I.

      A Phone-Controlled karaoke guessing game!
    description: >
      Our Team's 2nd-place submission at HackUMass 2019! We wanted to recreate kahoot-style gameplay but 
      take it a step further. We created this Karaoke guessing game as a fun roof of concept of what can be done!
      Hosting a lobby requires a Spotify account, and should be done in it's own window.

      A web-app providing resources and to opioid users and their families in Connecticut.

      Our Team's Winning Submission to the 2018 Connecticut Technology Council College Tech Challenge!
      It's a web-app providing resources and to opioid users and their families in Connecticut. It uses 
      data.ct.gov's rest API to access data and display helpful locations on Google Maps.

      Because Google now requires payment to use their maps API, some things may no longer show up correctly.

      My winning math-visualization project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon!
    description: >
      My winning project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon! Made in 24 hours, this is a version that has been adapted and
      optimized past that time limit for a single player, web experience. 
      The original was created for the Momath "Math Floor": A large, touchscreen floor.

      The project has been featured on the Museums instagram, and another web version was sent to Momath email 
      subscribers in May of 2020! It makes me happy that so many people have been able to enjoy something I made.

      My buddy Henry made this sprite in hopes of making a sidescrolling game.
      I made this song as the title track for the game.
      It never came to fruition, but I made this as a tribute.
