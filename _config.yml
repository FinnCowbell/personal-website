    I currently work at Microsoft as a software engineer.
    It's an honor to be able to grow my career at such a great company.
    I'm also humbled by all the help I've recieved from teammates, friends, and family.

    I've been making websites since elementary school. They started out as collages of various HTML embeds of games and websites.
    I've made personal websites since my coding career started in 2017. This one is a customized fork of Github's 
    personal-website repository. Last year, I redid the website using Tailwind CSS, implementing dark mode
    and fine-tuning various aspects of the site.

    At UConn, I earned a Music Minor, and participated in the Percussion Ensemble. I had the opportunity to play a variety of instruments, including Marimba, multi-percussion setups, and hitting a kitchen whisk against a chair!
    I am always open to new musical opportunities. In the past, I have played in Jazz bands, rock bands. I also was invited back to my high school to play in a pit orchestra once.

    When I'm not slouched over a computer solving problems, I like to rock climb. 
    I've been climbing for over 4 years. I enjoy how puzzling some climbs can be, and I love
    working to discover the solution. Conveniently, it also keeps me in shape!

    This past Summer, I was an intern at Pegasystems. I was a member of a scrum team in the UI Authoring squad. 
    I squashed bugs, added and revised unit tests, and helped implement features users can use to 
    design their UI for their Pega Platform Applications.
