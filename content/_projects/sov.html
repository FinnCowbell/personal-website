  My winning math-visualization project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon!

  My winning project at the 2018 Museum of Mathematics Hackathon! Made in 24 hours, this is a version that has been adapted and
  optimized past that time limit for a single player, web experience. 
  The original was created for the Momath "Math Floor": A large, touchscreen floor.

  The project has been featured on the Museums instagram, and another web version was sent to Momath email 
  subscribers in May of 2020! It makes me happy that so many people have been able to enjoy something I made.
