  My version of the board game "Secret Hitler" -- entirely online! 
  I made this so I could play one of my favorite board games with my friends while social distancing.
  It took about 2 weeks of focused development in May 2020 to make it fully playable, and gets
  frequent visits from my friends and I. It is now hosted at SecretHitler.js.org, so I removed the original 
  'Detective Dictator' branding.
