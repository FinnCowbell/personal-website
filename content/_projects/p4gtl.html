  A Phone-Controlled karaoke guessing game!
description: >
  Our Team's 2nd-place submission at HackUMass 2019! We wanted to recreate kahoot-style gameplay but 
  take it a step further. We created this Karaoke guessing game as a fun roof of concept of what can be done!
  Hosting a lobby requires a Spotify account, so if you want to host a game you should do it in a new window.
