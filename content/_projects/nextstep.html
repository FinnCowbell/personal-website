  Our team's winning submission to the 2018 Connecticut Technology Council College Tech Challenge!
  It's a web-app providing resources and to opioid users and their families in Connecticut. It uses 
  data.ct.gov's rest API to access data and display helpful locations on Google Maps. 

  Because Google requires payment to use their maps API, maps may no longer show up correctly.
technologies:
  - Bootstrap
  - Google Maps API
  - Socrata Open Data API
